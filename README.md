# kickstarter-analysis

## Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends 
Theater parent category had the most overall Kickstarter campaigns as well as most successful campaigns

*Out of 839 successful theater campaigns, the subcategory of 'plays' accounts for 694 successes

*Diving deeper into Theater successes, data on campaign launch dates proved to be an integral key to a campaign's success
1. The month of May appeared to show the largest peak in campaign successes with 111 successful campaigns
1. The month of June was a close second with 100 successful Theater campaigns
1. November and December showed a downward turn in successes, proving to be the lowest producing months, with December only garnering 37 successful campaigns

*In comparing the goal amounts and the pledged amounts, data showed that Failed campaigns had much higher goals than those of successful campaigns
Based on the findings, it is recommended to set a goal lower than $4,000 and to launch a campaign in the summer months of May or June

# Kickstarting with Excel Challenge

## Overview of Project
Using the Kickstarter data set, the project entails an in-depth look and comparison of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns in two ways: by launch date and by goal amount.

### Purpose
The purpose of the project was to determine any type of pattern or distinction when it comes down to when and in what way a campaign was successful. For example, in what months did campaigns see a rise in successes and what months showed a downturn? Additionally, did we see any success percentages with regards to the goal dollar amount? Did higher goal amounts result in more amounts of failed campaigns? Those are a few possible questions to think about when manipulating the data. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Launch date analysis did provide insight as to what time of year seemed to be much more successful for Kickstarter campaigns. The spring noted a rise in successes, but also a rise in total campaigns overall leading to the months of May and July having the highest successful campaign numbers. In contrast, from October on, there was a decrease in total campaigns as well as successful ones. It seems apparent that the Winter months of November, December, and January are not an ideal time to launch a Kickstarter campaign.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
While analyzing the outcomes based on Kickstarter campaign goals, the data was able to allude to a few key trends. The most successful percentage of positive outcomes with successes in over 70% of the total campaigns were the ranges of “Less than 1000” and “1000 – 4999”. These rangers also accounted for the most total amount of campaigns, so the high success percentage rate was successful. We can assume that the lower dollar amount contributed to the success rate. In contrast, the range of “Greater than 50000” showed the highest percentage rate of failed campaigns which could possibly support the previous theory.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Working with the COUNTIFS, although I was familiar with it, did provide some challenges. For example, I made sure to return to the Kickstarter tab to ensure accuracy and upon first check, noticed an error, and had to start over. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Two conclusions regarding the outcomes based on launch date are that summer months seem to be a more positive time to launch a campaign that will resound in a success whereas Winter months show to not be a great time with less amounts of campaigns overall but additionally far fewer successes.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The outcomes based on goal amounts provided sufficient data to suggest that lower goal amounts result in in a much higher percentage of successful campaigns. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
A possible limitation to the dataset could be not knowing the types of donors. Having that data could allude to many more insights regarding the type of year and also into the goals.
