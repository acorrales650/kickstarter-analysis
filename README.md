*Diving deeper into Theater successes, data on campaign launch dates proved to be an integral key to a campaign's success
1. The month of May appeared to show the largest peak in campaign successes with 111 successful campaigns
1. The month of June was a close second with 100 successful Theater campaigns
1. November and December showed a downward turn in successes, proving to be the lowest producing months, with December only garnering 37 successful campaigns

*In comparing the goal amounts and the pledged amounts, data showed that Failed campaigns had much higher goals than those of successful campaigns
Based on the findings, it is recommended to set a goal lower than $4,000 and to launch a campaign in the summer months of May or June
